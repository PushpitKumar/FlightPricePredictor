### 1. Overview/Problem Statement
In this ML model, we try to predict the flight fare using regression techniques such as LinearRegression RandomForest, XgBoost, etc. RandomForest gave the best results with minimum error and highest accuracy. The app was developed using flask framework in python and finally deployed on Heroku platform.
